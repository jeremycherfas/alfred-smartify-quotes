1.0.1 2022-09-20: added a Universal Action trigger for text

Intended for my use with Byword, should work with any text writer.

When I am writing posts that have YAML fontmatter. Smart quotes break the YAML, but straight quotes in the body are not rendered typographically by my CMS. 

This workflow allows me to select the body text, hit the trigger, and have the smartified text pasted back directly.

If you would prefer to have the replacement text added to the clipboard to paste wherever you prefer, change the setting in Copy to Clipboard.
